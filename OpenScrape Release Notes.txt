v1.1.9 2008-11-24
=================
BUG FIXES:
- Internal index not being updated when deleting a font record, causing a scrambling of OCR results when a T-transform 
  region was displayed after the delete.  Thanks to USBFreak for identifying the problem (OpenHoldem)
- "Edit"ing of size, symbol, region, font and hash point records in the previous release was non-functional.  Thanks to
  Ares for finding the bug.  (OpenHoldem)
- Fix for crash when opening graphical hash point editor.  Thanks to Ares for finding the bug.  (OpenHoldem)

v1.1.8 2008-10-21
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- Removal of fatal_error.log creation on crash.  This has been replaced by minidumps.
- Further stabilization of code tree, especially regarding class encapsulation and thread critical section handling.
- The Optimizer in the compiler has now been enabled by default for Release builds.


v1.1.7 2008-08-22
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- All level 3 compiler warnings have been addressed.

BUG FIXES:
- Eliminated artificial limitations on the number of font or hash records that can be present in any given tablemap (.tm) file.
  Previously this was set to 512 for each.  Thank you to Nick Coldhand & Folder for busting the limit.  (OpenHoldem)
  

v1.1.6 2008-08-22
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- Minidumps are now generated automatically upon a crash - dumps can be found in your OpenScrape
  startup directory. This feature requires dbghelp.dll to be distributed with OpenScrape.  This file
  should be placed in the same directory where OpenScrape.exe lives. 


v1.1.5 2008-05-16
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added image ("I") transform capability with perceptual difference algorithm (OpenHoldem)
- Removed warning and region removal for handle and slider regions, to support the
  addition of slider jamming code into OH. (BillW)
  
BUG FIXES:
- Removed the statusbar of the tablemap dialog, which caused mispositioning and flickering.
  Displaying the information about unscraped cards and fonts now in 2 text fields. (TheHighFish)

MAINTENANCE:
- As part of the pdiff implementation and tuning, I got tired of updating the table map load/save
  code in two places, and have moved this code to the CTransform class where it belongs.  A great
  deal of code was touched (more than I anticipated), so please test carefully.  (OpenHoldem)
  
  
v1.1.4 2008-04-25
================
NEW STUFF:
- Edit button functionality added for font records. Only character and font group can be changed. (BillW)

v1.1.3 2008-04-11
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$activemethod is now available.  This is used to determine how OH treats
  information from the pXactive and uXactive regions.
  - 1: (default, legacy) Inactive unless pXactive/uXactive returns true/active
  - 2: (new) Active unless pXactive/Uxactive returns false/inactive/out/away  (Thanks,
    Nick Coldhand)  (quiqsilver)


v1.1.2 2008-03-28
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$potmethod is now available.  This is used to determine the appropriate
  site interpretation for the contents of c0pot0.  s$potmethod can be set to these values:
  - 1: (default, legacy) Common pot
  - 2: (new) Total pot, including current bets and side bets  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
  (quiqsilver)


v1.1.1 2008-03-15
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$network is now available.  This is used to determine the appropriate
  network to pull Poker Tracker data for when s$sitename is not a PT supported site.  OH will
  first check s$sitename for a supported network name, then s$network.  These are the supported
  names for both s$sitename and s$network and must be lowercase: stars, party, ultimate, absolute,
  microgaming, ongame, cryptologic, pacific, fulltilt, b2b, tribeca, worldpex, ipoker, tain,
  bodog, everest, boss, and betfair. (quiqsilver)
  
- The entry window now has a status bar which displays common characters that are missing a font
  definition on the left side, and cards that are missing a hash on the right side for easy
  reference. (Thanks, Folder and dipitlow)
  - The entry window now has a "Tracker" section to set options for what is displayed in the status
    bar: (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
    - Fonts Set: Select which font set to display missing fonts for.
    - Fonts #: Select the number of fonts desired for each character in the currently selected set.
    - Cards #: Select the number of card hashes desired for each card. (quiqsilver)
    
- OpenScrape's behavior when creating hashes and images is now consistent with its font creation
  behavior: 
  - The selection will now return to the previously selected image or region respectively.
  - When the first hash or image is created, the respective section will gain the '+' button to
    indicate it now has a member and can be expanded. (quiqsilver)

BUG FIXES:
- Create Font button would search all groups to find unknown character when it should have
  only searched within the matching text group (spew)

- Launching a .tm file from the Windows shell launches OS, which crashes immediately. (quiqsilver)

- CTransform::h_transform; check for left>right or bottom>top added to prevent crashes.  (OpenHoldem)

- CTransform::do_plain_font_scan:  fix for searching of matching fonts across groups applied to
  CTransform class; same problem as Spew's fix above.

- Source code:  CTransform class (transform.cpp and transform.h) now live outside of the OpenHoldem and OpenScrape
  directories, so it can be shared without manually needing to copy code from place to place.  (OpenHoldem)
    

v1.1.0 2008-02-22
================
NEW STUFF:
- Table maps using fuzzy fonts can now be created.
  - Decide which fonts will be fuzzy, and create those in a specifc group (e.g. group 1).
    Fonts can be created with the font color as the foreground, or the background color
    as the foreground (inverse fonting).  If using the font color for the foreground, it is
    probably best to make the fonts as thick as possible using large radii.  If using the
    background color as the foreground, a radius of zero probably works best.
  - Set the symbol t1type to "fuzzy" for default tolerance (25%), or to a specific tolerance
    value (0.50 for 50%, 0.33 for 33%, for example).  If this symbol is set to anything besides
    "fuzzy" or a floating point value, then the engine will used the old pixel-by-pixel font
    recognition engine.
  - You can create multiple samples for various characters, and it will help.  6/8/3, for example
    are all so similar that distinguishing fuzzy versions of these is difficult.  Create more
    font records for the various 6's, 8s and 3's will help with the recognition.

- OpenHoldem and OpenScrape now use a unified CTransform class (this is found in the
  transform.cpp/.h files).

- Add Font (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont):
  - When adding font records via the add font dialog, the selection will now return to the
    previously selected region record, instead of nothing.
  - Known characters are now *not* added to the "Add Font" dialog.
  
- Added nudge buttons to move region around.  (Thanks to the many suggestions for this)

- Added tooltips to the main table map editor dialog.



BUG FIXES:
- Clicking new when "Size" was selected would not create a new size record on closure of the
  Add Sizes dialog box.  (Thanks, quiqsilver)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedNew)
  
- Rare bug fixed where clicking on "Create Font" and when the character separation algorithm
  detected characters in excess of the largest width allowed (31 pixels) would cause a crash.
  The algorithm now checks for more than 31 pixels and truncates the size of that character to 
  31 pixels.  (Thanks, the_whopper)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)
  
- Drawing region rectangles will now operate properly whether you draw top-left to bottom-right,
  bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right.
  (COpenScrapeView::OnLButtonUp, COpenScrapeView::OnMouseMove) (Thanks, cidertime)
  

v1.0.5 2008-02-15
================
BUG FIXES:
- More stupidity with clicking "New" and crashing has been corrected.  num_s$strings was 
  set to an incorrect value. (OpenScrapeDoc.h)
  

v1.0.4 2008-02-08
================
NEW STUFF:
- Commented out "Hash record created.  Don't forget to 'Edit/Update Hashes'." MessageBox.
  (Thanks, Nick)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateHash)
  

BUG FIXES:
- New button was not working for symbols and regions.  (Thanks, JumpingFences) 
  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedNew)
  


v1.0.3 2008-02-01
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added graphical hash point editor.  Select the "Hash Points" parent node in the tree and click the
  edit button.  Make sure to not select one of the specific hash point child records, as this will 
  bring up the editor for just that record - this capability has been retained in case you still need
  it.


BUG FIXES:
- Multiple t$ records specifying the same character are now allowed.  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)
- Internal fix to use SetItemData/GetItemData methods of CTreeCtrl, to allow for more efficient
  and flexible handling of data display when a tree item is clicked.   This was required by the
  multiple t$ record fix, and has been extended throughout the code base.  In addition, the
  SortChildren method of the CTreeCtrl class is now used instead of a manual bubble sort (the
  bubble sort was always intended as a quick testing piece, and just failed to get replaced
  by production code).  Sorry :(
- Changing zoom on an Image record would cause a crash.  (CDlgTableMap::OnZoomChange)


v1.0.2 2008-01-25
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added item to View menu to display the client size for the currently attached window
  if any.  (Thanks, Winngy)
  

BUG FIXES:
- The Add Font dialog will now default the font group of unknown characters to the text transform group
  of the currently selected region.  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)



v1.0.1 2008-01-11
================
NEW STUFF:
Nil.


BUG FIXES:
- Refresh button was not refreshing internal cache of screen bits, leading to
  incorrect images being saved.  (Bug identification by many, code  fix by UKbotter)
  Added new method, CMainFrame::SaveBmpPbits, and added calls to this function
  from OnViewConnecttowindow and OnViewRefresh.
  
- Per WinScrape specs, the maximum width of any given individual character in a text 
  transform field is 31 pixels.  Changed MAX_SINGLE_CHAR_WIDTH in structs_defines.h from
  30 to 31 to account for this.

- Added "t0type", "t1type", "t2type", "t3type" as valid symbols.  Although the OpenScrape/
  OpenHoldem engine does not yet support fuzzy text scraping, this have been added for
  handling future capabilities.
  
- Added "c0limits", "c0limits0", "c0limits1", "c0limits2", "c0limits3", "c0limits4", "c0limits5", 
  "c0limits6", "c0limits7", "c0limits8", "c0limits9" as valid symbols.  These were inadventently
  left out in version 1.0.0.

- Removed "h0type", "h1type", "h2type", "h3type" as valid symbols.  These are not used in OH/OS
  as there is only a single hashing algorithm used, and the hash seeds for the types 0-3 are 
  hard coded.
  
  
v1.0.0 2008-01-04
================
- First public release.
