The old Pacific poker client is great as a sample table map, as an exercise to see
how OpenScrape works.

=========================================

Un-install any client you might have installed (Add/Remove programs - Pacific poker)

Install the old client from the link below:
http://setupspcp1.888.com/setups/support/full/en/3.509/pacificpokersetup.exe

=========================================

Load the included "pacific.10.tm" into OpenScrape and connect to a Pacific table.

A shot of this table map loaded and connected to a table is included as well.

=========================================

This table map is *not* complete, and will not function on OpenHoldem.  It will need
to be completed to be usable.  The intention of this sample is not to provide a 
complete table map, but rather to illustrate how OpenScrape can be used to create
fully complete and operational table maps.
